    <h2 id="e122">Abstract</h2>
    <p id="e124">This study examined how the addition of modified cornstalk biochar (CB) affected ammonia
        (NH<sub>3</sub>) emissions during composting. Four treatments were established, including a control (CK)
        with layer manure and sawdust only, and the CK mixtures adding 10% HNO<sub>3</sub>CB (NA), 10%
        H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CB (HP) and 10% HNO<sub>3-</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2
            </sup>CB (MI). As the results showed, NH<sub>3</sub> emissions was reduced by 47.83% (NA), 61.69% (HP) and
            45.69% (MI) when the modified CB used as a compost additive (P &lt; 0.05). According to the data analysis,
            the
            addition of modified CB significantly increased the number of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), inhibited
            urease
            activity and decreased the abundance of <i>nar</i>G and <i>nir</i>S at rising temperatures and high
            temperatures
            (P &lt; 0.05). Redundancy analysis demonstrated a negative correlation between NH<sub>3</sub> emissions and
            AOB
            and a positive correlation with urease activity, <i>nar</i>G and <i>nir</i>S. Thus, the modified CB helped
            reduce NH<sub>3</sub> emissions by regulating nitrification processes.</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>China's laying hen industry has long been ranked first in the world in terms of its breeding scale and egg
        production, and the annual demand for commercial laying hens has remained between 1.3-1.5 billion. However, the
        resulting large amount of laying hen manure (LM) contains a large amount of pollutants, including suspended
        solids, salt, gas, bacteria and viruses; if directly discharged without proper disposal, this material will
        seriously pollute the surrounding air, water and soil (<a href="#r1">Wang et al., 2020</a>). Therefore, how to
        quickly and
        effectively deal with LM has become an important issue in the industry, restricting its sustainable development.
