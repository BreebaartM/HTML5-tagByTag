</span><span id="e169">1. Introduction
</span><span id="e170">China's laying hen industry has long been ranked first in the world in terms of its breeding scale and
</span><span id="e171">egg production, and the annual demand for commercial laying hens has remained between 1.3-1.5 billion.
</span><span id="e172">However, the resulting large amount of laying hen manure (LM) contains a large amount of pollutants,
</span><span id="e173">including suspended solids, salt, gas, bacteria and viruses; if directly discharged without proper disposal,
</span><span id="e174">this material will seriously pollute the surrounding air, water and soil (Wang et al., 2020). Therefore, how
</span><span id="e175">to quickly and effectively deal with LM has become an important issue in the industry, restricting its
</span><span id="e176">sustainable development.</span></p><p id="e177"><span id="e178">Composting is well-known as a transformation process from manure into reliable and stable final
</span><span id="e179">products served as substrates and nutrients for plant growth (Akdeniz, 2019; Tsui et al., 2019). The
</span><span id="e180">discharge of various harmful gases during the composting process has impeded the development of these
</span><span id="e181">practices (Rincon et al., 2019). Ammonia (NH</span><sub id="e182">3</sub><span id="e183">) emissions are a problem that cannot be ignored. NH</span><sub id="e184">3
</sub><span id="e185">volatilization is the major way of nitrogen loss from compost (Guo et al., 2020a). Prior studies have
</span><span id="e186">demonstrated that approximately 9.6%–46% of the initial total nitrogen (TN) is lost in the form of NH</span><sub id="e187">3</sub><span id="e188">,
</span><span id="e189">taking up 79%–94% of the TN loss during composting (de Guardia et al., 2008). During the temperature

</span><span id="e191">compounds through ammonization to produce NH</span><sub id="e192">3 </sub><span id="e193">(Chen et al., 2020a). Urease is the key enzyme</span></p><p id="e194"><span id="e195">catalyzing the decomposition of carbamide into NH</span><sub id="e196">3 </sub><span id="e197">and carbonic acid (Meng et al., 2020).

Nitrifying bacteria are mediumtemperature bacteria that cannot endure high temperatures. Therefore, without bacterial activity, </span><span id="e256">NH </span><span id="e257">" ! </span><span id="e258">N cannot be converted into </span><span id="e259">NO </span><sup id="e260">$ # -</sup><span id="e261">N. After the compost enters the cooling and decay stage, the
</span><span id="e262">temperature continues to decrease, nitrification is enhanced, ammonium nitrogen continues to decrease,
</span><span id="e263">NO </span><sup id="e264">$ # -</sup><span id="e265">N concentration increases, and NH</span><sub id="e266">3 </sub><span id="e267">volatilization decreases (Ren et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020b).

</span><span id="e300">(Yu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a).</span></p><p id="e301"><span id="e302">The methods currently used for NH</span><sub id="e303">3 </sub><span id="e304">emissions reduction during composting mainly include the
</span><span id="e305">addition of different microorganisms and bulking agents (Awasthi et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) and the
</span><span id="e306">adjustment of composting conditions (Akiyama et al., 2020). Among those, the employment of bulking
</span><span id="e307">agents is considered an effective way to decrease the amount of NH</span><sub id="e308">3 </sub><span id="e309">emissions (Chen et al., 2017; Guo
</span><span id="e310">et al., 2020b). The physiochemical properties of biochar vary in terms of different feedstocks used,
</span><span id="e311">including surface charge and specific surface areas (Sohi, 2020). Previous studies by our team showed
</span><span id="e312">that adding 10% bamboo biochar, cornstalk biochar, coir biochar, woody biochar and layer manure
</span><span id="e313">biochar to compost could reduce NH</span><sub id="e314">3 </sub><span id="e315">emissions by 22.70%, 33.11%, 21.51%, 32.87% and 24.19%,
</span><span id="e316">respectively (Chen et al., 2017). Adding cornstalk biochar to compost has NH</span><sub id="e317">3 </sub><span id="e318">emissions reducing effects.
</span><span id="e319">Recent evidence suggests that the addition of biochar can reduce NH</span><sub id="e320">3 </sub><span id="e321">emissions released during
</span><span id="e322">composting by 6.35%-36.20% (He et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2020). However, the current
</span><span id="e323">emission reduction efficiency is not high enough, and hence we hope to continue to improve the effect
</span><span id="e324">of ammonia emission reduction. HNO</span><sub id="e325">3 </sub><span id="e326">and H</span><sub id="e327">2</sub><span id="e328">O</span><sub id="e329">2 </sub><span id="e330">are commonly used biochar modification oxidants.

</span><span id="e382">2. Materials and methods
</span><span id="e383">2.1. Composting mixtures
</span><span id="e384">The materials of composting comprise layer manure (LM), sawdust (SW) and cornstalk biochar (CB),
</span><span id="e385">which were used as compost additives. The LM that we made use of was assembled from a chicken farm
</span><span id="e386">situated at the Experiment Station and Agriculture Training Center, South China Agricultural University,
</span><span id="e387">Guangzhou, China. The SW (2 mm mesh size) residue was collected from the Zengcheng District,
</span><span id="e388">Guangzhou, China, which is used to regulate the C/N ratio and moisture content of the compost. CB was
</span><span id="e389">acquired from the Henan Zhongbiao Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd. located in
</span><span id="e390">Zhengzhou. Twelve 19 L laboratory simulators for composting were used in the study, each of which was
</span><span id="e391">loaded with fresh LM (6.0 kg), SW (2.0 kg, which was 30% by wet weight (w/w) of the LM). The key
</span><span id="e392">physicochemical characteristics of LM, SW and BC are demonstrated in Table 1 and Table 2.
</span><span id="e393">2.2. Modified CB preparation
</span><span id="e394">First, the CB was immersed in deionized water for 24 h and then repeatedly washed until the water
</span><span id="e395">quality was clear to remove the impurities attached to the surface of the biochar. Then, the cleaned CB
</span><span id="e396">was placed in a stove and baked at 105 °C for 24 h. After being removed, it was cooled to room

</span><span id="e484">2.3. Experimental design
</span><span id="e485">The experiment was divided into four treatments. The mixture of LM and SW only (that is, without
</span><span id="e486">any CB) was treated as a control (CK), with different types of modified CB (0.80 kg, which was 10% by
</span><span id="e487">w/w of the LM and SW) added to the CK being other three treatments. =The treatments were labeled NA
</span><span id="e488">(for HNO</span><span id="e489">3-</span><span id="e490">modified CB), HP (for H</span><sub id="e491">2</sub><span id="e492">O</span><span id="e493">2-</span><span id="e494">modified CB), and MI (for HNO</span><sub id="e495">3 </sub><span id="e496">and H</span><sub id="e497">2</sub><span id="e498">O</span><sub id="e499">2 </sub><span id="e500">mixed-modified
</span><span id="e501">CB). All repeats three times per group. The initial moisture content of the composting mixtures was
</span><span id="e502">regulated to between 50% and 55%. Throughout the composting process, fresh air (0.2 m </span><sup id="e503">3</sup><span id="e504">·h-</span><sup id="e505">1</sup><span id="e506">·kg-</span><sup id="e507">1 </sup><span id="e508">) was
</span><span id="e509">constantly pumped into the compost by a whirlpool pump and a gas flowmeter. The temperature of each

</span><span id="e511">When the pile temperature dropped to ambient temperature, the composting stopped after 12 days.
</span><span id="e512">2.4. Sample collection
</span><span id="e513">The compost samples were collected on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 12. Each compost had an automatic
</span><span id="e514">turnover device to make it even, and -was flipped for 3 min before sampling each day. The samples were
</span><span id="e515">stored at -80 °C. The approaches of NH</span><sub id="e516">3 </sub><span id="e517">collection were performed similarly as previous studies (Chen
